//! The acceptance test for the bundled runtime: it must decode H.264.
//!
//! This drives LibVLC directly rather than through the `vlc` command-line tool,
//! because the CLI is not what ships. The addon is a library that the extension
//! loads, so the thing worth proving is that a media player built from the
//! bundled runtime decodes a known sample, and that is what this test does.
//!
//! Driving the CLI instead was tried first and abandoned. It is a Windows GUI
//! subsystem binary that needs a console it may not be able to attach, it reads
//! and writes the invoking user's configuration, it looks for plugins beside
//! itself rather than beside the runtime, and each of those produced a failure
//! that said nothing about the shipped bytes. None of it applies to a library.
//!
//! The video path exercised here is the software one, the same callbacks
//! src/vlc_media_player/software_video.rs registers, so a regression in the
//! runtime that breaks decoding for the extension breaks this test too.
//!
//! The test needs the runtime to be loadable, which is the harness's job:
//! scripts/test.ps1 puts the staged runtime on the library search path, and
//! scripts/acceptance_test.ps1 points it at the assembled addon so that the bytes
//! under test are the ones users receive.
